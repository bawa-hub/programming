# Steps to follow in DP problems:

a). Try to represent the problem in terms of index. [(i,j) in case of matrix] -> write base case
b). Do all possible stuffs on that index a/c to problem statement -> write recrurrrence relation
c). Sum of all stuffs -> if ques says count all ways
minimum( of all stuffs ) -> if ques says find min

# Recursive to iterative conversion

a). Declare base case
b). Express all states in for loop
c). copy the recurrence and write
