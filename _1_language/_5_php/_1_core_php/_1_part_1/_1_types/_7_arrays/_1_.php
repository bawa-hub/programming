<?php

// An array in PHP is actually an ordered map
// it can be treated as an array, list (vector), 
// hash table (an implementation of a map), dictionary, 
// collection, stack, queue, and probably more

// array values can be other arrays, 
// trees and multidimensional arrays are also possible.
