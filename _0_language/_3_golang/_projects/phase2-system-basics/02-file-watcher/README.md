# File System Watcher - Project 6

## Learning Objectives
- Master file system monitoring
- Understand inotify and file events
- Learn event-driven programming
- Practice system-level file operations

## Features to Implement
1. **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch file system changes
2. **Event Filtering**: Filter by event types (create, modify, delete)
3. **Recursive Watching**: Monitor directories and subdirectories
4. **Event Processing**: Handle and process file events
5. **Configuration**: Configurable watch patterns and exclusions
6. **Logging**: Detailed event logging and reporting

## Technical Concepts
- `github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify` for file watching
- Linux inotify system calls
- Event-driven architecture
- File system event types
- Pattern matching for file filtering
- Concurrent event processing

## Implementation Steps
1. Basic file watching setup
2. Add recursive directory monitoring
3. Implement event filtering
4. Create event processing pipeline
5. Add configuration management
6. Implement logging and reporting
7. Add performance optimization
8. Write comprehensive tests

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of file system events
- Experience with event-driven programming
- Knowledge of Linux inotify
- Practice with system-level monitoring
