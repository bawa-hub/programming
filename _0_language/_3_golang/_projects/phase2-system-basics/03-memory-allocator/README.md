# Custom Memory Allocator - Project 7

## Learning Objectives
- Master memory management concepts
- Understand allocation algorithms
- Learn about memory fragmentation
- Practice low-level memory operations

## Features to Implement
1. **Memory Pool**: Pre-allocated memory pools
2. **Allocation Strategies**: First-fit, best-fit, worst-fit
3. **Fragmentation Handling**: Coalescing and compaction
4. **Memory Tracking**: Track allocated and free blocks
5. **Performance Metrics**: Allocation/deallocation statistics
6. **Thread Safety**: Concurrent allocation support

## Technical Concepts
- `unsafe` package for memory manipulation
- Memory alignment and padding
- Linked lists for free block management
- Memory fragmentation algorithms
- `sync.Mutex` for thread safety
- Memory pool patterns

## Implementation Steps
1. Design memory pool structure
2. Implement basic allocation/deallocation
3. Add different allocation strategies
4. Implement fragmentation handling
5. Add thread safety
6. Create performance monitoring
7. Add memory leak detection
8. Write comprehensive tests

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of memory management
- Experience with low-level programming
- Understanding of allocation algorithms
- Practice with performance optimization
