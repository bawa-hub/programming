# Distributed Database - Project 13

## Learning Objectives
- Master distributed systems design
- Understand consensus algorithms
- Learn about CAP theorem and consistency models
- Practice building production-grade systems

## Features to Implement
1. **Distributed Architecture**: Multi-node cluster support
2. **Consensus Protocol**: Raft implementation for leader election
3. **Sharding**: Horizontal data partitioning
4. **Consistency Models**: Strong, eventual, and causal consistency
5. **Fault Tolerance**: Node failure handling and recovery
6. **Load Balancing**: Request distribution across nodes

## Technical Concepts
- Raft consensus algorithm
- Consistent hashing for sharding
- Vector clocks for causality
- Gossip protocols for membership
- Two-phase commit for transactions
- Circuit breakers for fault tolerance

## Implementation Steps
1. Design distributed architecture
2. Implement Raft consensus
3. Add sharding and data distribution
4. Implement consistency models
5. Add fault tolerance mechanisms
6. Create load balancing
7. Add monitoring and observability
8. Write comprehensive tests

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Mastery of distributed systems
- Understanding of consensus algorithms
- Experience with production systems
- Knowledge of fault tolerance patterns
