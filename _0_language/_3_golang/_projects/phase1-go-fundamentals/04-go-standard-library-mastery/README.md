# Go Standard Library Mastery 🚀

A comprehensive guide to mastering every important package in Go's standard library. This project is designed to give you deep, practical understanding of Go's built-in capabilities.

## 📚 Learning Structure

### 🎯 **Core Packages** (`core/`)
Essential packages every Go developer must master:
- `fmt` - Formatting and printing
- `os` - Operating system interface
- `io` - I/O primitives
- `time` - Time and date operations
- `math` - Mathematical functions
- `reflect` - Runtime reflection
- `errors` - Error handling
- `log` - Logging

### 📊 **Data Structures** (`data-structures/`)
Collections and data manipulation:
- `sort` - Sorting algorithms
- `container` - Container data structures
- `heap` - Heap operations
- `list` - Doubly linked lists
- `ring` - Circular lists

### 🌐 **Networking** (`networking/`)
Network programming and protocols:
- `net` - Network I/O
- `http` - HTTP client and server
- `url` - URL parsing
- `crypto` - Cryptographic functions
- `tls` - Transport Layer Security

### ⚡ **Concurrency** (`concurrency/`)
Parallel programming and synchronization:
- `sync` - Synchronization primitives
- `context` - Context management
- `atomic` - Atomic operations
- `runtime` - Runtime interface

### 🔄 **Encoding/Decoding** (`encoding/`)
Data serialization and formats:
- `json` - JSON encoding/decoding
- `xml` - XML processing
- `base64` - Base64 encoding
- `gob` - Go binary encoding
- `csv` - CSV processing

### 🛠️ **Utilities** (`utilities/`)
Common utility functions:
- `strings` - String manipulation
- `strconv` - String conversions
- `path` - Path manipulation
- `filepath` - File path operations
- `regexp` - Regular expressions
- `unicode` - Unicode utilities

### 🔧 **System** (`system/`)
System-level programming:
- `runtime` - Runtime control
- `unsafe` - Unsafe operations
- `syscall` - System calls
- `os/exec` - External commands
- `os/signal` - Signal handling

### 🚀 **Advanced** (`advanced/`)
Advanced and specialized packages:
- `plugin` - Plugin system
- `go/ast` - Abstract syntax trees
- `go/parser` - Go parser
- `go/token` - Token definitions
- `testing` - Testing framework
- `benchmark` - Performance testing

## 🎓 Learning Approach

Each package includes:
1. **📖 Comprehensive Notes** (`package_name.md`) - Theory, concepts, and best practices
2. **💻 Practical Examples** (`package_name.go`) - Working code examples
3. **🧪 Test Cases** (`package_name_test.go`) - Unit tests demonstrating usage
4. **🎯 Real-world Applications** - Practical use cases and patterns

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Navigate to a specific package
cd core/fmt

# Read the notes
cat fmt.md

# Run the examples
go run fmt.go

# Run the tests
go test -v

# Or run everything
go run main.go
```

## 📈 Learning Path

1. **Start with Core** - Master the essential packages first
2. **Practice Daily** - Run examples and modify them
3. **Build Projects** - Apply knowledge in real projects
4. **Read Source Code** - Study Go's standard library source
5. **Contribute** - Help improve Go or create libraries

## 🎯 Mastery Goals

By the end of this course, you will:
- ✅ Understand every important Go standard library package
- ✅ Know when and how to use each package effectively
- ✅ Write idiomatic Go code using standard library
- ✅ Debug and optimize using standard library tools
- ✅ Build robust, efficient applications
