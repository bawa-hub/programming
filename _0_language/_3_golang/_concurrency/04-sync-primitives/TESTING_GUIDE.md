# üß™ Synchronization Primitives Testing Guide

## üìã Test Overview

This guide covers comprehensive testing for the **Synchronization Primitives** topic, including basic examples, exercises, advanced patterns, and various testing methodologies.

## üöÄ Quick Test Commands

### 1. **Basic Examples**
```bash
go run . basic
```
**What it tests:** Core synchronization primitives including Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroup, Once, Cond, Atomic operations, Concurrent Map, Object Pool, and performance comparisons.

**Expected output:** 12 examples demonstrating different synchronization concepts with proper output and timing.

### 2. **Exercises**
```bash
go run . exercises
```
**What it tests:** 10 hands-on exercises covering practical synchronization scenarios.

**Expected output:** All exercises complete successfully with proper synchronization behavior.

### 3. **Advanced Patterns**
```bash
go run . advanced
```
**What it tests:** 10 advanced synchronization patterns including thread-safe counters, priority RWMutex, timeout WaitGroup, error handling Once, timeout conditions, atomic statistics, concurrent maps with stats, object pools with stats, barriers, and semaphores.

**Expected output:** All advanced patterns demonstrate sophisticated synchronization techniques.

### 4. **All Examples**
```bash
go run . all
```
**What it tests:** Runs all examples, exercises, and advanced patterns in sequence.

**Expected output:** Complete demonstration of all synchronization concepts.

## üîç Detailed Testing

### **Compilation Test**
```bash
go build .
```
**Purpose:** Ensures all code compiles without errors.
**Expected:** Clean compilation with no errors.

### **Race Detection Test**
```bash
go run -race . basic
```
**Purpose:** Detects data races in the code.
**Expected:** Should detect the intentional race condition in the "Race Condition Detection" example (this is educational and expected).

**Note:** The race detector correctly identifies intentional race conditions that demonstrate what NOT to do.

### **Static Analysis Test**
```bash
go vet .
```
**Purpose:** Performs static analysis to catch common mistakes.
**Expected:** Clean analysis with no warnings.

### **Performance Test**
```bash
go run . basic | grep "Performance"
```
**Purpose:** Verifies performance comparison examples work correctly.
**Expected:** Shows performance differences between mutex and atomic operations.

## üéØ Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Basic Mutex**
- **Test:** Multiple goroutines incrementing a shared counter
- **Expected:** Final counter value equals sum of all increments
- **Verification:** Counter value should be exactly 5000 (5 goroutines √ó 1000 increments each)

### **Scenario 2: RWMutex**
- **Test:** Multiple readers and one writer accessing shared data
- **Expected:** Readers can access data concurrently, writer has exclusive access
- **Verification:** No data corruption, proper read/write ordering

### **Scenario 3: WaitGroup**
- **Test:** Multiple workers completing tasks
- **Expected:** All workers complete before main goroutine continues
- **Verification:** All worker results are collected

### **Scenario 4: Once**
- **Test:** Multiple goroutines trying to initialize singleton
- **Expected:** Only one initialization occurs
- **Verification:** All goroutines get the same instance

### **Scenario 5: Condition Variables**
- **Test:** Goroutines waiting for a condition
- **Expected:** All waiters are notified when condition is met
- **Verification:** All waiters receive the signal

### **Scenario 6: Atomic Operations**
- **Test:** Multiple goroutines using atomic operations
- **Expected:** No data races, correct final value
- **Verification:** Counter value matches expected sum

### **Scenario 7: Concurrent Map**
- **Test:** Multiple goroutines storing and loading from sync.Map
- **Expected:** Thread-safe map operations
- **Verification:** All stored values can be retrieved

### **Scenario 8: Object Pool**
- **Test:** Multiple goroutines using object pool
- **Expected:** Objects are reused efficiently
- **Verification:** Pool statistics show reuse

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Compilation Errors**
   - **Symptom:** `go build .` fails
   - **Solution:** Check for syntax errors, missing imports, or type mismatches
   - **Common fix:** Ensure all types are properly defined

2. **Race Detection False Positives**
   - **Symptom:** Race detector reports unexpected races
   - **Solution:** The intentional race in "Race Condition Detection" is expected for educational purposes
   - **Note:** This demonstrates what NOT to do

3. **Deadlock Issues**
   - **Symptom:** Program hangs indefinitely
   - **Solution:** Check lock ordering, ensure all locks are released
   - **Prevention:** Use consistent lock ordering, always use defer

4. **WaitGroup Panics**
   - **Symptom:** `panic: sync: negative WaitGroup counter`
   - **Solution:** Ensure Add() is called before Done(), don't call Done() more than Add()
   - **Fix:** Use proper Add/Done pairing

5. **Mutex Leaks**
   - **Symptom:** Program hangs, goroutines blocked
   - **Solution:** Always use defer with mutex operations
   - **Fix:** `defer mu.Unlock()` after `mu.Lock()`

## üìä Performance Expectations

### **Mutex vs Atomic Performance**
- **Atomic operations** should be 2-4x faster than mutex operations
- **Expected ratio:** Atomic is typically 2-4x faster
- **Verification:** Check performance comparison output

### **RWMutex Benefits**
- **Read-heavy workloads** should benefit from RWMutex
- **Multiple readers** should be able to access data concurrently
- **Single writer** should have exclusive access

### **Object Pool Efficiency**
- **Pool reuse** should reduce allocation overhead
- **Statistics** should show objects being reused
- **Memory usage** should be more efficient
