## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Compilation Errors
- **Symptom**: `go build .` fails
- **Cause**: Syntax errors or missing imports
- **Solution**: Check code syntax and import statements

#### 2. Channel Deadlocks
- **Symptom**: Program hangs indefinitely
- **Cause**: Circular channel dependencies or blocking operations
- **Solution**: Use select with default case or buffered channels

#### 3. Channel Leaks
- **Symptom**: Goroutines that never exit
- **Cause**: Channels that are never closed
- **Solution**: Always close channels when done

#### 4. Race Conditions
- **Symptom**: Unpredictable behavior
- **Cause**: Unsafe channel access
- **Solution**: Use proper synchronization or channel ownership

#### 5. Memory Leaks
- **Symptom**: Increasing memory usage
- **Cause**: Goroutines that never exit or channels that accumulate data
- **Solution**: Proper goroutine lifecycle management

### Debug Commands

#### Verbose Output
```bash
go run -v . basic
```

#### Race Detection
```bash
go run -race . basic
```

#### Memory Profiling
```bash
go run -memprofile=mem.prof . basic
go tool pprof mem.prof
```

#### CPU Profiling
```bash
go run -cpuprofile=cpu.prof . basic
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```
