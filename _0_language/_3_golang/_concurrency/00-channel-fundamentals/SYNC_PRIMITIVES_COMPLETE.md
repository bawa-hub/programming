## ðŸ“š Complete Sync Primitives Coverage

### **Basic Primitives (1-6)**
1. **Mutex** - Mutual exclusion locks
2. **Race Conditions** - What happens without protection
3. **RWMutex** - Read-write locks for read-heavy workloads
4. **WaitGroup** - Wait for goroutines to complete
5. **Once** - One-time execution
6. **Cond** - Condition variables for waiting

### **Advanced Primitives (7-10)**
7. **Pool** - Object pooling for memory efficiency
8. **Map** - Concurrent map implementation
9. **Atomic** - Lock-free atomic operations
10. **Semaphore** - Counting semaphores for resource limiting

### **Common Patterns (11-15)**
11. **Producer-Consumer** - Using mutex for coordination
12. **Worker Pool** - Managing workers with WaitGroup
13. **Rate Limiting** - Controlling access with mutex
14. **Circuit Breaker** - Fault tolerance with mutex
15. **Graceful Shutdown** - Clean termination with WaitGroup

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts Mastered

### **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**
- **Purpose**: Protect shared resources from race conditions
- **When to use**: When multiple goroutines access shared data
- **Key points**: Always use `defer mu.Unlock()`, keep critical sections short

### **RWMutex (Read-Write Mutex)**
- **Purpose**: Allow multiple readers OR one writer
- **When to use**: Read-heavy workloads (80%+ reads)
- **Key points**: Readers can run concurrently, writers block all readers

### **WaitGroup**
- **Purpose**: Wait for collection of goroutines to finish
- **When to use**: Coordinating multiple goroutines
- **Key points**: Call `Add()` before goroutine, `Done()` inside goroutine

### **Once**
- **Purpose**: Execute function only once
- **When to use**: One-time initialization, singleton pattern
- **Key points**: Thread-safe, idempotent, very efficient

### **Cond (Condition Variables)**
- **Purpose**: Wait for conditions to become true
- **When to use**: Producer-consumer, resource waiting
- **Key points**: Must hold mutex before `Wait()`, use loop around `Wait()`

### **Pool**
- **Purpose**: Reuse objects to reduce GC pressure
- **When to use**: Frequently allocated objects
- **Key points**: Thread-safe, reduces memory allocations

### **Map**
- **Purpose**: Concurrent map implementation
- **When to use**: Multiple goroutines accessing map
- **Key points**: Read-optimized, more memory overhead than regular map

### **Atomic Operations**
- **Purpose**: Lock-free operations
- **When to use**: Simple counters, flags, lock-free algorithms
- **Key points**: Very fast, limited to specific types

```

### Check for Common Mistakes
```bash
go vet sync-primitives-examples.go
```
