## ðŸ’¡ Problem-Solving Tips

### 1. **Read the Problem Carefully**
- Understand what the problem is asking for
- Note the expected output format
- Identify the key channel concepts involved

### 2. **Start Simple**
- Begin with basic channel operations
- Add complexity gradually
- Test your solution frequently

### 3. **Handle Edge Cases**
- Check for nil channels
- Handle closed channels properly
- Consider timeout scenarios

### 4. **Use Proper Error Handling**
- Check channel state with `ok` idiom
- Use select with default for non-blocking operations
- Handle context cancellation

### 5. **Follow Go Idioms**
- Use channels for communication
- Prefer channels over shared memory
- Close channels when done

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Concepts Covered

### Basic Concepts
- Channel creation and initialization
- Send and receive operations
- Channel direction (send-only, receive-only)
- Channel closing and state checking
- Range over channels

### Channel Types
- Unbuffered channels (synchronous)
- Buffered channels (asynchronous)
- Channel capacity and length
- Nil channels and their behavior

### Operations
- Blocking vs non-blocking operations
- Select statements
- Timeout handling
- Multiple channel operations

### Patterns
- Signal patterns
- Data transfer patterns
- Worker patterns
- Pipeline patterns

### Error Handling
- Channel state checking
- Error propagation
- Timeout handling
- Context cancellation

---

## ðŸš¨ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Deadlocks**
- Sending to nil channels
- Receiving from nil channels
- Circular dependencies
- Sending to unbuffered channels without receivers

### 2. **Panics**
- Sending to closed channels
- Closing already closed channels
- Receiving from closed channels (safe, but returns zero value)

### 3. **Memory Leaks**
- Not closing channels
- Keeping references to large data
- Goroutine leaks

### 4. **Race Conditions**
- Accessing shared data without synchronization
- Using channels incorrectly for synchronization
