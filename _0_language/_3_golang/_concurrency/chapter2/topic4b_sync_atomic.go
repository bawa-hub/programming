// âœ… Also race-free â€” and even faster than using a mutex.

// ðŸ§  Interview Insights
// Question | Smart Answer
// Whatâ€™s a race condition? | Concurrent access to shared data where at least one access is a write, leading to undefined behavior.
// How do you fix it in Go? | Use sync.Mutex, sync/atomic, or channels.
// Is counter++ atomic in Go? | No â€” it's three separate operations.
// How do you detect races? | Use go run -race.

// âœ… Recap

//     Race conditions = subtle and dangerous.

//     Use mutexes or atomic ops to protect shared data.

//     Use -race to find hidden bugs early.
