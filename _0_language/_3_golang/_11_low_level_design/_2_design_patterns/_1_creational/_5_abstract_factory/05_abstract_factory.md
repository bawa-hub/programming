## Introduction

The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's like a factory of factories - it creates other factories.

## Problem Statement

**When to use Abstract Factory Pattern?**
- When you need to create families of related products
- When you want to ensure products from the same family are used together
- When you want to provide a library of products and reveal only their interfaces
- When you need to support multiple product families

**Common Scenarios:**
- Creating UI components for different operating systems
- Creating database connections for different database types
- Creating payment processors for different payment methods
- Creating document formats for different applications

## Solution

The Abstract Factory pattern provides:
1. **Abstract Factory Interface** - Declares creation methods for each product type
2. **Concrete Factories** - Implement creation methods for specific product families
3. **Abstract Products** - Declare interfaces for product types
4. **Concrete Products** - Implement product interfaces for specific families

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. Basic Abstract Factory
- Abstract factory interface with methods for each product type
- Concrete factories implement the interface
- Products are created through the factory

### 2. Factory Registry
- Registry manages available factories
- Client requests factories by family type
- More flexible and extensible

### 3. Generic Abstract Factory
- Uses generics for type safety
- More modern approach
- Better compile-time checking

## Abstract Factory vs Factory Method

### Factory Method
- Creates objects of a single type
- Uses inheritance
- One method per product type

### Abstract Factory
- Creates families of related objects
- Uses composition
- Multiple methods for different product types

## Pros and Cons

### ‚úÖ Pros
- **Product Consistency**: Ensures products from the same family work together
- **Loose Coupling**: Client code doesn't depend on concrete classes
- **Easy to Extend**: Easy to add new product families
- **Single Responsibility**: Each factory is responsible for one product family

### ‚ùå Cons
- **Complexity**: Can be complex to implement
- **Many Classes**: May result in many factory classes
- **Hard to Extend**: Adding new product types requires changing all factories

## Real-world Examples

1. **UI Framework**: Create UI components for different platforms
2. **Database Abstraction**: Create database connections for different databases
3. **Payment Processing**: Create payment processors for different payment methods
4. **Document Processing**: Create document readers/writers for different formats
5. **Game Development**: Create game objects for different game modes

## Code Structure

```go
// Abstract Factory interface
type AbstractFactory interface {
    CreateProductA() ProductA
    CreateProductB() ProductB
}

// Concrete Factory
type ConcreteFactory1 struct{}

func (cf *ConcreteFactory1) CreateProductA() ProductA {
    return &ConcreteProductA1{}
}

func (cf *ConcreteFactory1) CreateProductB() ProductB {
    return &ConcreteProductB1{}
}
```

## Next Steps

After mastering Abstract Factory pattern, move to:
- **Structural Patterns** - For organizing classes and objects
- **Adapter Pattern** - For making incompatible interfaces work together
- **Bridge Pattern** - For separating abstraction from implementation

**Remember**: Abstract Factory is perfect for creating families of related objects. It ensures consistency and makes your code more maintainable! üöÄ
