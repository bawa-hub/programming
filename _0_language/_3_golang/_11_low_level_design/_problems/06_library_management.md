## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Book Status Management
- **Available**: Book is on shelf and can be borrowed
- **Borrowed**: Book is currently checked out
- **Reserved**: Book is reserved by a member
- **Lost**: Book is reported as lost
- **Maintenance**: Book is being repaired or processed

### 2. Member Types and Privileges
- **Student**: Can borrow up to 5 books for 14 days
- **Faculty**: Can borrow up to 10 books for 30 days
- **General**: Can borrow up to 3 books for 14 days
- **VIP**: Can borrow up to 15 books for 30 days with priority

### 3. Fine Calculation
- **Overdue Fine**: $0.50 per day for first week, $1.00 per day after
- **Lost Book Fine**: Replacement cost + processing fee
- **Damage Fine**: Based on damage assessment
- **Maximum Fine**: Capped at book replacement cost

### 4. Reservation System
- **Queue Management**: First-come-first-served basis
- **Notification**: Email/SMS when book becomes available
- **Expiration**: 48-hour window to pick up reserved book
- **Priority**: VIP members get priority in queue

### 5. Search and Discovery
- **Full-Text Search**: Search across title, author, description
- **Filtering**: By category, availability, publication year
- **Sorting**: By relevance, popularity, date added
- **Recommendations**: Based on borrowing history

### 6. Data Consistency
- **Atomic Transactions**: All book operations are atomic
- **Concurrent Access**: Handle multiple simultaneous checkouts
- **Data Validation**: Validate all inputs and business rules
- **Audit Trail**: Track all system changes
