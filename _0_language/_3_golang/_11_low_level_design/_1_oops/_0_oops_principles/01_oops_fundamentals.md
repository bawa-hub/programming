## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which contain data (attributes) and code (methods). It's the foundation of modern software design and is crucial for Low Level Design interviews.

### Why OOPS Matters in LLD Interviews?

1. **Design Thinking**: OOPS helps you think in terms of real-world entities
2. **Code Organization**: Proper encapsulation and modularity
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and extend code
4. **Reusability**: Write once, use many times
5. **Interview Focus**: Most LLD questions test your OOPS understanding

## Four Pillars of OOPS

### 1. Encapsulation üè†

**Definition**: Bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit (class).

**Key Points**:
- Data hiding using access modifiers (private, protected, public)
- Provides controlled access to data through methods
- Prevents external code from directly accessing internal state

**Benefits**:
- Data integrity
- Security
- Easier maintenance
- Clear interface

**Interview Tip**: Always ask about access modifiers and data hiding in your design.

### 2. Inheritance üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

**Definition**: Mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class.

**Key Points**:
- "IS-A" relationship
- Code reusability
- Method overriding
- Single and multiple inheritance

**Benefits**:
- Code reuse
- Polymorphism
- Hierarchical organization

**Interview Tip**: Be careful about deep inheritance hierarchies. Prefer composition over inheritance.

### 3. Polymorphism üîÑ

**Definition**: Ability of objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.

**Types**:
- **Compile-time Polymorphism**: Method overloading
- **Runtime Polymorphism**: Method overriding

**Benefits**:
- Flexibility
- Extensibility
- Interface consistency

**Interview Tip**: Polymorphism is crucial for designing extensible systems.

### 4. Abstraction üé≠

**Definition**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features.

**Key Points**:
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Focus on "what" not "how"
- Contract definition

**Benefits**:
- Simplifies complex systems
- Reduces complexity
- Better maintainability

**Interview Tip**: Use interfaces to define contracts between different components.

## SOLID Principles

SOLID principles are five design principles that make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) üéØ

**Definition**: A class should have only one reason to change.

**Example**: A User class should only handle user data, not email sending.

**Benefits**:
- Easier testing
- Better maintainability
- Clearer code

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) üîì

**Definition**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Example**: Use interfaces and abstract classes to allow extension without changing existing code.

**Benefits**:
- Extensibility
- Stability
- Reduced risk

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) üîÑ

**Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without breaking the application.

**Example**: If Bird is a superclass, any Bird subclass should be usable wherever Bird is expected.

**Benefits**:
- Proper inheritance
- Polymorphism works correctly
- Design consistency

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) üîå

**Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

**Example**: Instead of one large interface, create multiple smaller, focused interfaces.

**Benefits**:
- Loose coupling
- Better maintainability
- Clearer contracts

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Example**: Use dependency injection and interfaces.

**Benefits**:
- Loose coupling
- Testability
- Flexibility

## Composition vs Inheritance

### When to Use Inheritance? üß¨

- **IS-A relationship**: Car IS-A Vehicle
- **Code reuse**: Common behavior across classes
- **Polymorphism**: Need to treat objects uniformly

### When to Use Composition? üß©

- **HAS-A relationship**: Car HAS-A Engine
- **Flexibility**: Can change behavior at runtime
- **Multiple behaviors**: Can combine multiple components

### The Favor Composition Rule

**Prefer composition over inheritance** because:
- More flexible
- Easier to test
- Less coupling
- Better for complex hierarchies
