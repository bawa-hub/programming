# Go Basics Mastery - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
A comprehensive hands-on course for mastering Go's fundamental data types and concepts. This project provides deep understanding of Go's core features through practical examples and real-world applications.

## ✅ What You'll Master

### 1. Primitive Data Types
- **Numeric Types**: int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, float32, float64, complex64, complex128
- **Boolean Type**: bool with logical operations
- **String Type**: string, rune, and Unicode handling
- **Type Conversions**: Explicit and implicit conversions
- **Constants**: const declarations and iota patterns
- **Zero Values**: Understanding default values for all types

### 2. Arrays and Slices
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections with indexing
- **Slices**: Dynamic arrays with powerful operations
- **Slice Operations**: append, copy, slicing, capacity management
- **Range Loops**: Iterating over collections efficiently
- **Multi-dimensional**: 2D and 3D arrays/slices
- **Memory Management**: Understanding slice memory characteristics

### 3. Structs
- **Basic Structs**: Field definitions and initialization
- **Methods**: Value and pointer receivers
- **Struct Embedding**: Composition over inheritance
- **Anonymous Structs**: Inline struct definitions
- **Struct Tags**: JSON and other metadata
- **Struct Comparison**: Understanding comparable vs non-comparable structs

### 4. Interfaces
- **Interface Definition**: Method signatures and contracts
- **Interface Implementation**: Implicit implementation
- **Empty Interface**: interface{} and type assertions
- **Interface Composition**: Combining multiple interfaces
- **Type Switches**: Runtime type checking
- **Polymorphism**: Same interface, different implementations

### 5. Pointers
- **Pointer Basics**: Address and dereference operators
- **Pointer to Struct**: Method receivers and field access
- **Pointer to Slice**: Memory management and sharing
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Safe pointer operations (limited in Go)
- **Nil Pointers**: Safety and checking
- **Pointer Chaining**: Pointers to pointers
