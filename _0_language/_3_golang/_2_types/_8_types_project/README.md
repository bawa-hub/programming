# Go Basics Mastery Project

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Master all fundamental Go data types and concepts through hands-on practice and practical examples.

## 📚 What You'll Master

### 1. Primitive Data Types
- **Numeric Types**: int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, float32, float64, complex64, complex128
- **Boolean Type**: bool
- **String Type**: string and rune
- **Type Conversions**: Explicit and implicit conversions
- **Constants**: const declarations and iota

### 2. Arrays and Slices
- **Arrays**: Fixed-size collections
- **Slices**: Dynamic arrays with powerful operations
- **Slice Operations**: append, copy, slicing, capacity
- **Range Loops**: Iterating over collections
- **Multi-dimensional**: 2D and 3D arrays/slices

### 3. Structs
- **Basic Structs**: Field definitions and initialization
- **Methods**: Value and pointer receivers
- **Struct Embedding**: Composition over inheritance
- **Anonymous Structs**: Inline struct definitions
- **Struct Tags**: JSON and other metadata

### 4. Interfaces
- **Interface Definition**: Method signatures
- **Interface Implementation**: Implicit implementation
- **Empty Interface**: interface{} and type assertions
- **Interface Composition**: Combining interfaces
- **Type Switches**: Runtime type checking

### 5. Pointers
- **Pointer Basics**: Address and dereference operators
- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Safe pointer operations
- **Pointer to Struct**: Method receivers
- **Pointer to Slice**: Memory management
- **Nil Pointers**: Safety and checking

2. **Run Examples**: Execute each example to see output
3. **Modify Code**: Experiment with different values and operations
4. **Solve Exercises**: Complete the exercises in each module
5. **Build Examples**: Create your own examples combining concepts

## 📖 Learning Path

1. **Start with primitives/** - Master basic data types
2. **Move to arrays-slices/** - Understand collections
3. **Study structs/** - Learn object-oriented concepts
4. **Explore interfaces/** - Master polymorphism
5. **Practice pointers/** - Understand memory management
6. **Combine in examples/** - See everything working together

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After completing this project, you should be able to:
- Confidently work with all Go data types
- Understand when to use arrays vs slices
- Design effective structs with proper methods
