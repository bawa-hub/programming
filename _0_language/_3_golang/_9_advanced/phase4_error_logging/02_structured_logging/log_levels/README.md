# ðŸ“Š Log Levels Mastery

## Overview
Master the art of structured logging with proper log levels, filtering, and performance optimization.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Log Level Hierarchy
- **TRACE**: Most verbose, detailed execution flow
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging
- **INFO**: General information about program execution
- **WARN**: Warning messages for potential issues
- **ERROR**: Error events that might still allow the application to continue
- **FATAL**: Very severe error events that will abort the application

### 2. Log Level Configuration
- Dynamic log level switching
- Environment-based configuration
- Runtime log level changes
- Performance impact analysis

### 3. Structured Logging
- JSON-formatted logs
- Key-value pairs
- Consistent field naming
- Log correlation IDs

### 4. Log Filtering and Routing
- Level-based filtering
- Category-based routing
- Multiple output destinations
- Conditional logging

### 5. Performance Considerations
- Lazy evaluation
- Log level checking
- Memory allocation optimization
- Async logging patterns

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the complete log level hierarchy
- Implement dynamic log level configuration
- Create structured, searchable logs
- Optimize logging performance
- Build flexible log routing systems

## Prerequisites
- Basic Go knowledge
- Understanding of logging concepts
- Familiarity with JSON formatting

## Next Steps
After mastering log levels, proceed to:
- **Contextual Logging**: Adding context to your logs
- **Log Aggregation**: Collecting and processing logs
- **Performance Impact**: Optimizing logging performance
