# ðŸ”’ SYNCHRONIZATION PRIMITIVES MASTERY
*"The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible." - Edsger W. Dijkstra*

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Master
- Mutexes and RWMutexes
- WaitGroups and Once
- Condition variables
- Atomic operations
- Lock-free programming techniques

## ðŸ“š Learning Path
1. **Mutexes** - Mutual exclusion and shared data protection
2. **Atomic** - Lock-free operations and memory ordering
3. **Projects** - Real-world synchronization applications

Let's master the art of safe concurrency! ðŸš€
