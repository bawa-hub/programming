# ðŸ§  MEMORY OPTIMIZATION MASTERY

## Overview
Master advanced memory optimization techniques in Go including stack vs heap allocation, escape analysis, memory pooling, and zero-allocation programming.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Stack vs Heap Allocation
- Understanding Go's memory model
- Escape analysis and allocation decisions
- Stack allocation benefits and limitations
- Heap allocation costs and optimization

### 2. Escape Analysis
- How Go determines stack vs heap allocation
- Common escape scenarios
- Avoiding unnecessary heap allocations
- Analyzing escape decisions

### 3. Memory Pooling Techniques
- Object pooling patterns
- Sync.Pool usage and best practices
- Custom memory pools
- Pool lifecycle management

### 4. Zero-Allocation Programming
- Techniques to minimize allocations
- String building optimization
- Slice pre-allocation strategies
- Avoiding allocations in hot paths

## Learning Objectives
