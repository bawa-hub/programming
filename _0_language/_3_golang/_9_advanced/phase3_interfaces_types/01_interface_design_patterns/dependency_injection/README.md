# ðŸ’‰ DEPENDENCY INJECTION MASTERY

## Overview
Master dependency injection patterns in Go including constructor injection, interface injection, and service locator patterns.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Constructor Injection
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- Interface-based dependencies
- Dependency resolution
- Lifecycle management

### 2. Interface Injection
- Interface-based injection patterns
- Service interfaces
- Implementation swapping
- Testing with mocks

### 3. Service Locator Pattern
- Service registration and resolution
- Service containers
- Dependency graphs
- Circular dependency handling

### 4. Advanced DI Patterns
- Factory patterns
- Builder patterns
- Singleton patterns
- Scoped dependencies

## Learning Objectives
- Understand dependency injection principles
- Master constructor injection in Go
- Implement interface-based injection
- Use service locator patterns
- Handle complex dependency graphs
