🔥 Phase 1: Core Golang (Master the Language)

These are non-negotiables. Even senior devs must be rock solid here.
📌 1. Go Fundamentals

    Go installation, workspace (GOPATH vs Go Modules)

    Basic syntax, data types

    Constants, variables, type inference

    Operators, control flow

    Functions (value vs reference, variadic)

📌 2. Composite Types

    Arrays, Slices (backing array concept, slice tricks)

    Maps (usage, delete, range, nil maps)

    Structs, embedding (composition), tags

    Pointers and memory layout

📌 3. Methods & Interfaces

    Methods vs Functions

    Pointer receivers vs value receivers

    Interfaces (empty interface, type assertions, type switches)

    Interface composition and idioms (io.Writer, io.Reader, etc.)

    Duck typing in Go

📌 4. Packages and Modules

    Package system

    go mod, go.sum

    Import rules

    Project structure

    Error handling idioms (errors, fmt.Errorf, wrap)

📌 5. Error Handling

    Idiomatic error handling

    Sentinel errors, custom error types

    Wrapping/unwrapping errors

    errors.Is, errors.As, errors.Join

⚙️ Phase 2: Intermediate Golang (Deep Dive Concepts)
📌 6. Concurrency

    Goroutines

    Channels (buffered/unbuffered)

    Channel patterns: fan-in, fan-out, select

    Context: cancelation, timeout, deadline

    Mutex, RWMutex, atomic

    sync.WaitGroup, sync.Once

    Best concurrency patterns for production

📌 7. Memory Management & Performance

    Escape analysis

    Value vs pointer types

    Garbage Collection (GC tuning)

    Profiling with pprof

    Benchmarking using testing and go test -bench

    Allocation optimization

📌 8. Go Routines Leaks & Race Conditions

    Detecting leaks

    Preventing leaks with context

    Race conditions and how to detect/fix (go run -race)

    Safe concurrent patterns

🧠 Phase 3: Advanced Golang Topics
📌 9. Advanced Interfaces & Reflection

    reflect package (use cases, performance concerns)

    Building libraries that work on any type (generic-ish without generics)

    Dynamic struct manipulation (use in ORMs, JSON tools)

📌 10. Generics (Go 1.18+)

    Type parameters

    Constraints

    Writing generic libraries

    Type sets, performance impact

📌 11. Testing in Go

    Unit testing with testing package

    Table-driven tests

    Mocking (manual vs tools like gomock)

    Integration testing

    Coverage & benchmarking

    Fuzzing (Go 1.18+)

📌 12. Go Tooling & Build System

    go vet, golint, staticcheck

    go fmt, go mod tidy, go generate

    go build flags

    go test flags

    go run vs go install

    Performance profiling (pprof, trace)

🌐 Phase 4: Production Engineering with Go
📌 13. Building Web Services (HTTP & gRPC)

    net/http, routers (chi, gorilla/mux)

    Middleware pattern

    Context and cancellation

    JSON encoding/decoding

    gRPC + Protobuf + Streaming

    Client retry, deadline, backoff logic

📌 14. Dependency Injection

    Manual DI in Go

    Uber’s dig, fx

    Go’s philosophy against heavy DI frameworks

📌 15. Logging, Tracing & Metrics

    Logging with log, zap, logrus

    Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)

    Prometheus metrics

    Structured logging, correlation IDs

📌 16. Microservices Patterns

    Clean Architecture in Go

    Repository Pattern

    Service/Controller layers

    Health checks, graceful shutdown

    Circuit breakers (resilience), retries

📦 Phase 5: System Design + Real-World Projects in Go
🔧 Real-World Projects to Build:

    URL Shortener with Redis backend (covers REST, persistence, caching)

    Concurrent Web Crawler (channels, goroutines, error groups)

    Distributed Worker System (message queues + goroutines)

    In-memory Key-Value Store (Redis clone with basic TTL)

    Rate Limiter Library (leaky bucket or token bucket)

    gRPC Microservice System (auth, data, logging, gateway)

🧠 Phase 6: Interview Prep for Senior Golang Roles
📌 Golang-Specific Interview Topics:

    Interface tricks and usage

    Deep dive on concurrency

    When to use channels vs mutex

    Code design and idioms

    Performance tuning & profiling

    Memory model, escape analysis

    Goroutine lifecycle

📌 System Design Rounds (in Go)

    Build a high-QPS URL shortener

    Design a real-time chat system in Go

    Build a distributed cache service

    Design a log aggregation system
