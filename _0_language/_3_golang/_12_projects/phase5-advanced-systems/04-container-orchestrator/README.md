# Container Orchestrator - Project 16

## Learning Objectives
- Master container orchestration concepts
- Understand Kubernetes internals
- Learn about resource management and scheduling
- Practice building production container platforms

## Features to Implement
1. **Container Runtime**: Basic container execution
2. **Scheduler**: Resource-aware task scheduling
3. **Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration
4. **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution
5. **Health Checks**: Container health monitoring
6. **Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on metrics

## Technical Concepts
- Linux namespaces and cgroups
- Container runtime interfaces (CRI)
- Resource quotas and limits
- Service mesh patterns
- Health check protocols
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

## Implementation Steps
1. Design orchestrator architecture
2. Implement container runtime
3. Add resource scheduling
4. Create service discovery
5. Implement load balancing
6. Add health monitoring
7. Create auto-scaling
8. Write comprehensive tests

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of container orchestration
- Experience with Kubernetes concepts
- Knowledge of resource management
- Practice with production container platforms
