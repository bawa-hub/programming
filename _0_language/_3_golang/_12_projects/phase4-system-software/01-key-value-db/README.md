# Key-Value Database - Project 9

## Learning Objectives
- Master database system design
- Understand storage engines and indexing
- Learn about ACID properties
- Practice distributed systems concepts

## Features to Implement
1. **Storage Engine**: B-tree based storage with WAL
2. **ACID Transactions**: Atomic operations with rollback
3. **Indexing**: Primary and secondary indexes
4. **Persistence**: Disk-based storage with memory caching
5. **Replication**: Master-slave replication
6. **Query Interface**: SQL-like query language

## Technical Concepts
- B-tree data structures
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
- MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
- LSM-trees for write optimization
- Consistent hashing for sharding
- Raft consensus algorithm

## Implementation Steps
1. Design storage engine architecture
2. Implement B-tree storage
3. Add WAL for durability
4. Implement transaction support
5. Add indexing capabilities
6. Create replication system
7. Add query interface
8. Write comprehensive tests

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of database internals
- Experience with storage engine design
- Knowledge of distributed systems
- Practice with consensus algorithms
