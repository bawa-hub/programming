# Signal Handler - Project 8

## Learning Objectives
- Master signal handling in Go
- Understand process lifecycle management
- Learn graceful shutdown patterns
- Practice system-level process control

## Features to Implement
1. **Signal Registration**: Handle various system signals
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean resource cleanup on termination
3. **Signal Broadcasting**: Forward signals to child processes
4. **Custom Signal Handling**: Define custom signal behaviors
5. **Signal Logging**: Log and track signal events
6. **Process Groups**: Handle signals for process groups

## Technical Concepts
- `os/signal` package for signal handling
- `syscall` package for signal constants
- Process groups and sessions
- Signal propagation to child processes
- Context cancellation patterns
- Resource cleanup strategies

## Implementation Steps
1. Basic signal handling setup
2. Implement graceful shutdown
3. Add signal broadcasting
4. Create custom signal handlers
5. Add signal logging and monitoring
6. Implement process group handling
7. Add comprehensive error handling
8. Write integration tests

## Expected Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of signal handling
- Experience with process lifecycle
- Knowledge of graceful shutdown patterns
- Practice with system-level programming
