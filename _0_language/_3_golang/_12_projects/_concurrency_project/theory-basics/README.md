# Go Concurrency Theory - Complete Learning Guide

## 🎯 Learning Path: From Zero to Expert

This folder contains a comprehensive, theory-based approach to learning Go concurrency. Each file focuses on one specific concept with:

- **Clear Theory**: What the concept is and why it exists
- **Simple Examples**: Basic code to understand the concept
- **Advanced Examples**: More complex usage patterns
- **Common Pitfalls**: What to avoid and why
- **Best Practices**: How to use it correctly
- **Exercises**: Hands-on practice problems

## 🚀 How to Use This Guide

1. **Read in Order**: Start with file 01 and work your way through
2. **Code Along**: Type out every example, don't just read
3. **Experiment**: Modify the examples and see what happens
4. **Run with Race Detection**: Always use `go run -race` and `go test -race`
5. **Complete Exercises**: Do the practice problems at the end of each file

## 🛠️ Essential Commands

```bash
# Always run with race detection
go run -race filename.go

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race

# Check for race conditions
go run -race .

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=.
```

## 📖 Prerequisites

- Basic Go knowledge (variables, functions, structs)
- Go 1.19+ installed
- Understanding of basic programming concepts

## 🎯 Success Criteria
