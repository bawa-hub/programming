```
**What it tests:** Runs all examples, exercises, and advanced patterns in sequence.

**Expected output:** Complete demonstration of all worker pool concepts.

## üîç Detailed Testing

### **Compilation Test**
```bash
go build .
```
**Purpose:** Ensures all code compiles without errors.
**Expected:** Clean compilation with no errors.

### **Race Detection Test**
```bash
go run -race . basic
```
**Purpose:** Detects data races in the code.
**Expected:** Clean race detection with no races found.

**Note:** Worker pools should be race-free when properly implemented.

### **Static Analysis Test**
```bash
go vet .
```
**Purpose:** Performs static analysis to catch common mistakes.
**Expected:** Clean analysis with no warnings.

### **Performance Test**
```bash
go run . basic | grep "Performance"
```
**Purpose:** Verifies performance comparison examples work correctly.
**Expected:** Shows performance differences between sequential and worker pool processing.

## üéØ Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Basic Worker Pool**
- **Test:** Multiple workers processing tasks from a shared channel
- **Expected:** Tasks are distributed evenly among workers
- **Verification:** All tasks are processed, workers are utilized efficiently

### **Scenario 2: Buffered Worker Pool**
- **Test:** Worker pool with buffered channels for better performance
- **Expected:** Improved throughput with reduced blocking
- **Verification:** Tasks are processed faster with buffered channels

### **Scenario 3: Dynamic Worker Pool**
- **Test:** Worker pool that adjusts number of workers based on workload
- **Expected:** Workers are added when queue size increases
- **Verification:** Worker count changes based on queue size

### **Scenario 4: Priority Worker Pool**
- **Test:** Worker pool that processes high-priority tasks first
- **Expected:** High-priority tasks are processed before low-priority tasks
- **Verification:** Priority ordering is maintained

### **Scenario 5: Worker Pool with Results**
- **Test:** Worker pool that collects and processes results
- **Expected:** Results are collected and processed as they arrive
- **Verification:** All results are processed correctly

### **Scenario 6: Worker Pool with Error Handling**
- **Test:** Worker pool that handles errors from workers
- **Expected:** Errors are collected and handled gracefully
- **Verification:** Both successes and errors are processed

### **Scenario 7: Worker Pool with Timeout**
- **Test:** Worker pool that handles timeouts for individual tasks
- **Expected:** Tasks timeout after specified duration
- **Verification:** Timeout behavior is correct

### **Scenario 8: Worker Pool with Rate Limiting**
- **Test:** Worker pool that limits the rate of task processing
- **Expected:** Tasks are processed at the specified rate
- **Verification:** Rate limiting is enforced

### **Scenario 9: Worker Pool with Metrics**
- **Test:** Worker pool that collects performance metrics
- **Expected:** Metrics are collected and reported
- **Verification:** Metrics show expected values

### **Scenario 10: Pipeline Worker Pool**
- **Test:** Worker pool that processes tasks through multiple stages
- **Expected:** Tasks flow through pipeline stages correctly
- **Verification:** Pipeline processing works as expected

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Compilation Errors**
   - **Symptom:** `go build .` fails
   - **Solution:** Check for syntax errors, missing imports, or type mismatches
   - **Common fix:** Ensure all types are properly defined

2. **Race Conditions**
   - **Symptom:** Race detector reports data races
   - **Solution:** Use proper synchronization primitives
   - **Prevention:** Avoid shared mutable state, use channels for communication

3. **Deadlock Issues**
   - **Symptom:** Program hangs indefinitely
   - **Solution:** Check channel operations, ensure proper cleanup
   - **Prevention:** Use select with default cases, proper channel closing

4. **Goroutine Leaks**
   - **Symptom:** Program doesn't terminate, goroutines keep running
   - **Solution:** Ensure all goroutines are properly cleaned up
   - **Fix:** Use WaitGroup, close channels, use context for cancellation

5. **Performance Issues**
   - **Symptom:** Worker pool is slower than expected
   - **Solution:** Check worker count, channel buffer sizes, task distribution
   - **Fix:** Optimize worker count, use buffered channels, improve task distribution

## üìä Performance Expectations

### **Worker Pool vs Sequential Processing**
- **Worker pool** should be 5-10x faster than sequential processing
- **Expected speedup:** 5-10x for CPU-bound tasks
- **Verification:** Check performance comparison output

### **Buffered vs Unbuffered Channels**
- **Buffered channels** should improve throughput
- **Reduced blocking** on channel operations
- **Better resource utilization**

### **Dynamic Worker Pool**
- **Workers should be added** when queue size increases
- **Workers should be removed** when queue is empty
- **Adaptive behavior** based on workload
