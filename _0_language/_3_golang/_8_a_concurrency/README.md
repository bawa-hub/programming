## 🏆 Learning Path

### Phase 1: Foundations (Weeks 1-2)
- Master goroutines, channels, select, and sync primitives
- Understand basic concurrency patterns
- Build confidence with simple concurrent programs

### Phase 2: Patterns (Weeks 3-4)
- Learn essential concurrency patterns
- Implement worker pools, pipelines, and pub-sub
- Understand when and how to apply each pattern

### Phase 3: Advanced (Weeks 5-6)
- Dive deep into context, memory model, and error handling
- Master performance optimization techniques
- Learn to debug and profile concurrent code

### Phase 4: Real-World (Weeks 7-8)
- Build production-ready concurrent systems
- Handle microservices, databases, and caching
- Implement event-driven architectures

### Phase 5: God Level (Weeks 9-12)
- Create custom concurrency primitives
- Master distributed concurrency
- Become a concurrency mentor and expert

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
