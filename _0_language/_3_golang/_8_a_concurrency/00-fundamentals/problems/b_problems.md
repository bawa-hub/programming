## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts to Practice

- **Channel Communication**: Sending and receiving data
- **Synchronization**: Coordinating goroutines
- **Turn-Taking**: Alternating execution
- **Signaling**: Start/stop/ready signals
- **Data Flow**: Passing data between goroutines
- **Ordering**: Ensuring proper sequence
- **Coordination**: Multiple goroutines working together

## ðŸ”§ Testing Your Solutions

```bash
# Compile and test
go build basic_sync_problems.go
go run basic_sync_problems.go 1

# Run with race detection
go run -race basic_sync_problems.go 1

# Check for common mistakes
go vet basic_sync_problems.go
```
