# 🚀 PHASE 3: INTERFACES & TYPE SYSTEM MASTERY

*"The art of programming is the art of organizing complexity, of mastering multitude and avoiding its bastard chaos as effectively as possible." - Edsger W. Dijkstra*

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this phase, you will:
- Master interface design patterns and composition
- Achieve advanced type system mastery
- Become a reflection wizard
- Design clean, maintainable architectures
- Create flexible, extensible Go applications
