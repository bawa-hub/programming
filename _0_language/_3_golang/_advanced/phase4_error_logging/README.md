# üö® PHASE 4: ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING MASTERY
*"Errors are values, and values can be handled with god-like precision."*

Welcome to **Phase 4** of your Go God transformation! You've mastered concurrency, memory management, and type systems. Now it's time to become a **Error Handling & Logging God** - someone who can handle any error with surgical precision and create observability systems that would make the gods themselves jealous.

---

## üéØ **WHAT YOU'LL MASTER**

### **üö® Advanced Error Handling**
- **Custom Error Types** - Design error hierarchies that tell a story
- **Error Wrapping & Unwrapping** - Chain errors like a master storyteller
- **Error Recovery Strategies** - Graceful degradation and resilience patterns
- **Error Context & Tracing** - Track errors through complex systems
- **Panic Recovery** - Handle the unhandleable with god-like grace

### **üìù Structured Logging Mastery**
- **Log Levels & Filtering** - Control the noise, amplify the signal
- **Contextual Logging** - Rich, structured logs that tell the whole story
- **Log Aggregation Patterns** - Centralized logging for distributed systems
- **Performance Impact** - Log without slowing down your application
- **Log Rotation & Management** - Keep your logs organized and efficient

### **üîç Tracing & Metrics**
- **Distributed Tracing** - Follow requests across microservices
- **Prometheus Metrics** - Expose metrics that matter
- **Health Checks** - Know when your system is sick before it dies
- **Monitoring Patterns** - Production-ready observability
- **Alerting & Notifications** - Wake up the right people at the right time
