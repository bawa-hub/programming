# 🚀 GOD-LEVEL: Distributed Concurrency

## 📚 Theory Notes

### **Distributed Concurrency Fundamentals**

Distributed concurrency deals with coordinating operations across multiple nodes in a distributed system. It's about ensuring consistency, availability, and fault tolerance when multiple processes work together.

#### **Key Challenges:**
1. **Network Partitions** - Nodes can't communicate
2. **Node Failures** - Nodes can crash or become unresponsive
3. **Clock Skew** - Different nodes have different time
4. **Message Ordering** - Messages can arrive out of order
5. **Byzantine Failures** - Nodes can behave maliciously

### **Consensus Algorithms**

#### **What is Consensus?**
Consensus is the process of getting multiple nodes to agree on a single value or decision. It's fundamental to distributed systems.

#### **Consensus Properties:**
- **Agreement** - All nodes decide on the same value
- **Validity** - The decided value was proposed by some node
- **Termination** - All nodes eventually decide
- **Integrity** - No node decides twice

#### **Raft Consensus Algorithm:**

**Raft States:**
- **Leader** - Handles client requests and log replication
- **Follower** - Receives log entries from leader
- **Candidate** - Attempts to become leader

**Raft Process:**
1. **Leader Election** - Nodes compete to become leader
2. **Log Replication** - Leader replicates log entries
3. **Safety** - Ensures consistency across nodes

**Raft Benefits:**
- **Understandable** - Easier to understand than Paxos
- **Implementable** - Many production implementations
- **Fault Tolerant** - Handles node failures

```go
type RaftNode struct {
    id       string
    state    string // leader, follower, candidate
    term     int64
    leader   bool
}
```

#### **Paxos Algorithm:**
- **Proposer** - Proposes values
- **Acceptor** - Accepts or rejects proposals
- **Learner** - Learns chosen values

#### **PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance):**
- Handles Byzantine failures
- Requires 3f+1 nodes to tolerate f failures
- More complex than Raft

### **Distributed Locks**

#### **What are Distributed Locks?**
Distributed locks coordinate access to shared resources across multiple nodes. They prevent race conditions in distributed systems.

#### **Lock Requirements:**
- **Mutual Exclusion** - Only one node can hold lock
- **Deadlock Freedom** - No deadlocks possible
- **Fault Tolerance** - Handle node failures
- **Performance** - Low latency and high throughput

#### **Redis Distributed Locks:**

**Implementation:**
```go
// SET key value NX EX seconds
SET lock:resource1 "node1" NX EX 30
```

**Benefits:**
- **Simple** - Easy to implement
- **Fast** - Redis is fast
- **TTL** - Automatic expiration

**Drawbacks:**
- **Single Point of Failure** - Redis failure
- **Clock Skew** - Time synchronization issues

#### **Zookeeper Distributed Locks:**

**Implementation:**
- Create sequential ephemeral nodes
- Watch previous node
- Acquire lock when previous node is deleted

**Benefits:**
- **Fault Tolerant** - Zookeeper handles failures
- **Ordered** - Sequential nodes provide ordering
- **Watches** - Event-driven notifications

**Drawbacks:**
- **Complex** - More complex than Redis
- **Slower** - Higher latency than Redis

#### **Chubby Lock Service:**
- **Coarse-grained** - Fewer, longer-lived locks
- **High Availability** - Replicated service
- **Consistent** - Strong consistency guarantees

### **Leader Election**

#### **What is Leader Election?**
Leader election is the process of selecting a single node to act as the coordinator or leader in a distributed system.

#### **Leader Election Requirements:**
- **Safety** - At most one leader at any time
- **Liveness** - Eventually elect a leader
- **Fault Tolerance** - Handle node failures
- **Performance** - Fast election process

#### **Bully Algorithm:**

**Process:**
1. Node starts election by sending message to higher priority nodes
2. If no response, node becomes leader
3. If response received, wait for leader announcement

**Benefits:**
- **Simple** - Easy to understand
- **Deterministic** - Highest priority node wins

**Drawbacks:**
- **O(n²) messages** - Many messages required
- **Not fault tolerant** - Single point of failure

#### **Ring Algorithm:**

**Process:**
1. Pass token around ring
2. Node with token can become leader
3. Token passing continues until leader elected

**Benefits:**
- **O(n) messages** - Linear message complexity
- **Fault tolerant** - Handles node failures

**Drawbacks:**
- **Ring topology** - Requires ring structure
- **Token loss** - Token can be lost

#### **Raft Leader Election:**

**Process:**
1. Nodes start as followers
2. If no leader, node becomes candidate
3. Candidate requests votes from other nodes
4. If majority votes, becomes leader

**Benefits:**
- **Fault tolerant** - Handles failures
- **Consistent** - Strong consistency
- **Understandable** - Clear algorithm

### **Distributed Transactions**

#### **What are Distributed Transactions?**
Distributed transactions ensure ACID properties across multiple nodes. They coordinate operations that span multiple systems.

#### **ACID Properties:**
- **Atomicity** - All operations succeed or all fail
- **Consistency** - System remains in valid state
- **Isolation** - Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- **Durability** - Committed changes persist

#### **Two-Phase Commit (2PC):**

**Phases:**
1. **Prepare Phase** - Coordinator asks participants to prepare
2. **Commit Phase** - Coordinator tells participants to commit

**Process:**
```
Coordinator -> Participants: PREPARE
Participants -> Coordinator: VOTE (YES/NO)
Coordinator -> Participants: COMMIT/ABORT
```

**Benefits:**
- **ACID** - Ensures atomicity
- **Simple** - Easy to understand

**Drawbacks:**
- **Blocking** - Can block on failures
- **Single Point of Failure** - Coordinator failure
- **Performance** - High latency

#### **Three-Phase Commit (3PC):**

**Phases:**
1. **CanCommit Phase** - Check if commit is possible
2. **PreCommit Phase** - Prepare to commit
3. **DoCommit Phase** - Actually commit

**Benefits:**
- **Non-blocking** - Reduces blocking
- **Fault tolerant** - Better failure handling

**Drawbacks:**
- **Complex** - More complex than 2PC
- **Still blocking** - Can still block

#### **Saga Pattern:**

**Process:**
1. Execute steps in order
2. If step fails, compensate for completed steps
3. Use compensating transactions

**Benefits:**
- **Non-blocking** - No blocking on failures
- **Fault tolerant** - Handles failures gracefully
- **Scalable** - Good for microservices

**Drawbacks:**
- **Complex** - Hard to implement
- **Eventual consistency** - Not ACID

### **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**

#### **What are Byzantine Failures?**
Byzantine failures occur when nodes can behave arbitrarily, including maliciously. They can send different messages to different nodes.

#### **Byzantine Fault Tolerance Requirements:**
- **Agreement** - All non-faulty nodes agree
- **Validity** - Non-faulty nodes decide on valid value
- **Termination** - Non-faulty nodes eventually decide

#### **PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance):**

**Process:**
1. **Request** - Client sends request to primary
2. **Pre-prepare** - Primary sends pre-prepare message
3. **Prepare** - Replicas send prepare messages
4. **Commit** - Replicas send commit messages
5. **Reply** - Replicas send reply to client

**Requirements:**
- **3f+1 nodes** - To tolerate f Byzantine failures
- **Synchronous** - Bounded message delays

**Benefits:**
- **Byzantine fault tolerant** - Handles malicious nodes
- **Practical** - Used in production systems

**Drawbacks:**
- **High overhead** - Many messages required
- **Synchronous** - Requires bounded delays

#### **Honey Badger BFT:**

**Process:**

- **Robust** - Handles network issues
- **Efficient** - Good performance

**Drawbacks:**
- **Complex** - Hard to implement
- **Newer** - Less battle-tested

### **CAP Theorem**

#### **What is CAP Theorem?**
CAP Theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee 2 out of 3 properties:
- **Consistency** - All nodes see same data
- **Availability** - System remains available
- **Partition Tolerance** - System works despite network partitions

#### **CAP Trade-offs:**

**CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):**
- **Examples** - MongoDB, HBase
- **Trade-off** - Sacrifice availability for consistency
- **Use case** - When consistency is critical

**AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance):**
- **Examples** - Cassandra, DynamoDB
- **Trade-off** - Sacrifice consistency for availability
- **Use case** - When availability is critical

**CA Systems (Consistency + Availability):**
- **Examples** - Traditional RDBMS
- **Trade-off** - Don't handle network partitions
- **Use case** - Single-node systems

#### **CAP in Practice:**
- **Most systems** - Choose AP or CP
- **Network partitions** - Are inevitable
- **Consistency levels** - Can be relaxed
- **Eventual consistency** - Often acceptable

### **Consistency Models**

#### **Strong Consistency:**
- **Linearizability** - Operations appear atomic
- **Sequential Consistency** - Operations appear sequential
- **Causal Consistency** - Respects causality

#### **Weak Consistency:**
- **Eventual Consistency** - Eventually consistent
- **Monotonic Read** - Reads don't go backwards
- **Monotonic Write** - Writes are ordered

#### **Consistency Levels:**
- **One** - Single node consistency
- **Quorum** - Majority of nodes
- **All** - All nodes consistent

### **Performance Considerations**

#### **Latency:**
- **Network latency** - Round-trip time
- **Processing latency** - Computation time
- **Queueing latency** - Wait time

#### **Throughput:**
- **Messages per second** - System capacity
- **Operations per second** - Business capacity
- **Bandwidth** - Network capacity

#### **Scalability:**
- **Horizontal scaling** - Add more nodes
- **Vertical scaling** - More powerful nodes
- **Load balancing** - Distribute load

### **When to Use Distributed Concurrency**

#### **Good Use Cases:**
- **Distributed systems** - Multiple nodes
- **Fault tolerance** - Handle failures
- **Consistency** - Ensure data consistency
- **Coordination** - Coordinate operations

#### **Not Good For:**
- **Single node** - Unnecessary overhead
