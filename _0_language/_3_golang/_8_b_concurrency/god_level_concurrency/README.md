## üéØ Current Status

### **Phase 1: DEEP THEORY & INTERNALS** ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Go Runtime Scheduler Deep Dive** - Understanding G-M-P model, work stealing, preemption
- [x] **Memory Model & Synchronization** - Happens-before relationships, atomic operations, false sharing
- [x] **Lock-Free Programming** - CAS operations, lock-free data structures, ABA problem solutions

### **Phase 2: PERFORMANCE MASTERY** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] **Profiling & Benchmarking** - `go tool pprof` mastery, performance optimization
- [ ] **Advanced Optimization Techniques** - Pooling, batching, NUMA awareness

## üöÄ How to Use This Training

### **1. Theory First**
Read the `.md` files to understand the concepts:
- `01_scheduler_notes.md` - Go runtime scheduler theory
- `02_memory_model_notes.md` - Memory model and synchronization theory
- `03_lock_free_notes.md` - Lock-free programming theory

### **2. Practice Implementation**
Run the `.go` files to see concepts in action:
```bash
go run 01_scheduler_deep_dive.go
go run 02_memory_model.go
go run 03_lock_free_programming.go
```

### **3. Experiment and Learn**
- Modify the code to see different behaviors
- Add your own examples
- Test with different parameters
- Use profiling tools to measure performance
