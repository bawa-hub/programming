# Project 4: Advanced Concurrency

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master advanced concurrency patterns and techniques
- Learn about context cancellation and timeouts
- Practice with advanced worker pool patterns
- Build a high-performance concurrent system
- Understand memory management in concurrent programs

## 📚 What You'll Build

### 1. Advanced Worker Pool System
A sophisticated worker pool with dynamic scaling, load balancing, and health monitoring.

### 2. Context-Based Cancellation System
A system that uses context for cancellation, timeouts, and deadline management.

### 3. Pipeline with Backpressure
A multi-stage pipeline that handles backpressure gracefully.

### 4. Concurrent Data Structures
Thread-safe data structures optimized for high-performance concurrent access.

### 5. Memory Pool System
A memory pool for efficient memory management in concurrent applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Run all examples
go run main.go

# Run specific components
go run main.go advanced_worker_pool.go
go run main.go context_system.go
go run main.go pipeline_backpressure.go
go run main.go concurrent_data_structures.go

# Run tests
go test -v

# Run with race detection
go run -race main.go
```
