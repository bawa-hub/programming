- **What you'll learn**: Goroutines, channels, select statements, basic synchronization
- **Key files**: `main.go`, `calculator.go`, `calculator_test.go`, examples/
- **Time to complete**: 1-2 weeks

#### **Project 2: Synchronization Primitives** 📋 READY
- **Status**: Structure and curriculum ready
- **What you'll learn**: Mutex, RWMutex, WaitGroup, atomic operations, race conditions
- **Project**: Thread-safe cache with multiple readers/writers
- **Time to complete**: 1-2 weeks

#### **Project 3: Common Concurrency Patterns** 📋 READY
- **Status**: Structure and curriculum ready
- **What you'll learn**: Fan-in/fan-out, pipelines, generators, timeout patterns
- **Project**: Real-time data processing pipeline
- **Time to complete**: 1-2 weeks

#### **Project 4: Advanced Concurrency** 📋 READY
- **Status**: Structure and curriculum ready
- **What you'll learn**: Worker pools, context package, graceful shutdown
- **Project**: High-performance web scraper with worker pool
- **Time to complete**: 1-2 weeks

#### **Project 5: Real-world Application** 📋 READY
- **Status**: Structure and curriculum ready
- **What you'll learn**: HTTP servers, database concurrency, monitoring
- **Project**: Concurrent REST API with rate limiting & monitoring
- **Time to complete**: 1-2 weeks

### 🚀 How to Get Started

1. **Start with Project 1** (already working!):
   ```bash
   cd project1-basic-goroutines
   go run main.go
   go test -v
   ```

2. **Follow the learning path** in each project's README

3. **Use the Quick Start Guide** for essential commands and tips

### 🛠️ Key Features of This Curriculum

- **Hands-on Learning**: Every concept is learned by building real projects
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Each project builds on the previous one
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All projects include tests and benchmarks
- **Race Detection**: Always use `go run -race` and `go test -race`
- **Real-world Examples**: Projects solve actual problems you'll encounter
- **Production Ready**: Final project is deployable and production-ready

### 📖 Learning Resources Included

- **Detailed READMEs** for each project with clear objectives
- **Working Code Examples** that you can run immediately
- **Comprehensive Tests** to verify your understanding
- **Benchmarking Tools** to measure performance
- **Example Patterns** showing different approaches
- **Quick Start Guide** with essential commands

### 🎯 Success Metrics

By the end of this curriculum, you'll be able to:
- ✅ Write safe, concurrent Go programs
- ✅ Debug race conditions and deadlocks
- ✅ Design scalable concurrent systems
- ✅ Use all Go concurrency primitives effectively
- ✅ Build production-ready concurrent applications
- ✅ Optimize concurrent code for performance

### 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Start with Project 1** - it's ready to go!
2. **Follow the 10-week timeline** (2 weeks per project)
3. **Code every day** - don't just read, build!
4. **Use race detection** - always run with `-race`
5. **Write tests** - verify your understanding
6. **Experiment** - try different approaches

### 🆘 Need Help?

- Each project has detailed READMEs with exercises
- All code is well-commented and documented
- Examples show different patterns and approaches
- Tests verify your implementation

### 🎉 Ready to Start?

```bash
cd project1-basic-goroutines
go run main.go
```

**Happy coding! You're about to become a Go concurrency expert! 🚀**
