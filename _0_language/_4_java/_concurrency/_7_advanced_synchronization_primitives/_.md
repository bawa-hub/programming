# Advanced Synchronization Primitives

In concurrent programming, synchronization primitives help manage access to shared resources, coordinate threads, and ensure data consistency. While basic primitives like mutexes and semaphores are commonly used, advanced synchronization primitives provide additional flexibility and control in complex concurrency scenarios.

1. Barriers
Definition

A barrier is a synchronization primitive that allows multiple threads to wait for each other at a predefined point, ensuring that all threads reach this point before any can proceed.

    Typically used when you need to synchronize threads at a specific stage in their execution.
    Often used in parallel algorithms where multiple tasks must be completed before moving forward.

Example Use Case

You have a parallel algorithm where several threads must perform some computation, and you want to ensure they all reach the same point before continuing.

2. Latches
Definition

A latch is a synchronization primitive used to block a thread until a certain condition is met, typically until a certain number of threads have completed a task.

    A common example is CountDownLatch in Java, where threads wait until a counter reaches zero before proceeding.

Use Case

When multiple threads need to wait for some event to occur before continuing their execution, like waiting for all threads to complete initialization before starting processing.

3. CyclicBarrier vs. CountDownLatch

    CyclicBarrier: Reusable, can be reset and reused after the barrier condition is met.
    CountDownLatch: One-time use, the latch cannot be reset after its countdown reaches zero.

4. Exchangers
Definition

An Exchanger is a synchronization primitive that allows two threads to exchange objects at a specific point in time. Each thread provides an object to the other and receives the object from the other thread.

    Itâ€™s commonly used when two threads need to pass data back and forth, often in scenarios where two threads work together and need to synchronize their actions.

5. Semaphore
Definition

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that controls access to a shared resource by multiple threads. It maintains a set of permits, and each thread must acquire a permit before proceeding.

    Binary Semaphore: Acts like a lock (0 or 1).
    Counting Semaphore: Allows multiple permits to be held simultaneously.


Summary of Advanced Synchronization Primitives
Primitive	Description	Key Use Case
Barrier	Synchronize threads at a specific point, ensuring all arrive first.	Parallel tasks needing synchronization before proceeding.
Latch	Blocks threads until a condition (counter reaching zero) is met.	Wait for multiple threads to finish before proceeding.
Exchanger	Allows two threads to exchange objects.	Exchange data between two threads in a synchronized manner.
Semaphore	Controls access to shared resources by multiple threads.	Manage access to a fixed number of resources (e.g., database connections).
