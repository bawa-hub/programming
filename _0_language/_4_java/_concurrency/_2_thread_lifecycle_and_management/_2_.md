The thread lifecycle describes the various states a thread can exist in during its execution. 
Proper management of threads involves understanding their lifecycle, priorities, scheduling, and roles


Thread Lifecycle States

A thread goes through various states during its lifetime. These states are:

    New
        A thread is created but hasn’t started execution yet.
        Example: In Java, Thread t = new Thread();.

    Runnable
        The thread is ready to run and is waiting for CPU time. It’s not guaranteed to be running immediately.
        Example: After calling t.start() in Java.

    Running
        The thread is actively executing its task on the CPU.

    Blocked/Waiting
        The thread is waiting for a resource to become available or a signal from another thread.
        Example: When a thread calls wait() or tries to access a synchronized block that’s locked by another thread.

    Terminated
        The thread has finished its execution or is explicitly stopped.


Daemon vs. User Threads

Threads in most programming languages are either daemon or user threads. The key difference lies in how they affect the application's lifecycle.

    User Threads:
        These threads keep the JVM or application running.
        The application will not exit until all user threads are finished.

    Daemon Threads:
        These are background threads that provide services to user threads.
        They do not prevent the JVM or application from shutting down.
        Example: The Garbage Collector in Java is implemented as a daemon thread.


Thread Priorities and Scheduling Policies

    Thread Priorities:
        Threads can be assigned a priority to indicate their importance.
        Higher-priority threads are more likely to be executed first but are not guaranteed.
        Priority levels vary between platforms, but typical ranges are:
            Java: Thread.MIN_PRIORITY (1) to Thread.MAX_PRIORITY (10).
            Python: Threads do not have explicit priorities.
            Go: Goroutines are lightweight and do not support explicit priorities.

    Thread Scheduling:
        Preemptive Scheduling: Threads are preempted based on priority and time slicing (e.g., Java).
        Cooperative Scheduling: Threads voluntarily yield control (e.g., older systems like Windows 3.x).

Thread Pools and Executors

Creating and managing threads individually can lead to overhead and resource wastage. Thread pools allow efficient reuse of threads.

    What is a Thread Pool?
        A collection of pre-initialized threads that can be reused for tasks.
        Benefits:
            Reduces thread creation overhead.
            Limits the number of concurrent threads.
