// why State after start: comes before State in run() ?

/**
 * 
 * Explanation

    thread.start() is called in main()
        This does not immediately run the run() method.
        Instead, it moves the thread to the RUNNABLE state, meaning it's eligible for execution but waiting for the CPU.

    JVM schedules the new thread (MyThread)
        The main thread prints "State after start: RUNNABLE", because at this point, the new thread has not yet started runningâ€”it is just waiting in the RUNNABLE state.

    The CPU switches to the new thread (MyThread)
        Now, run() starts executing, and it prints "State in run(): RUNNABLE".

Key Point: Why This Happens?

    start() does not immediately call run().
    Thread scheduling is handled by the JVM and OS, which means there's a slight delay between calling start() and the actual execution of run().
    Meanwhile, the main thread continues execution without waiting, so it prints the state before run() begins.

Order of Execution

ðŸ”¹ Thread main executes first:

    Calls start()
    Prints "State after start: RUNNABLE"
    Moves to the next statement

ðŸ”¹ Thread MyThread starts running later:

    JVM schedules it
    Executes run()
    Prints "State in run(): RUNNABLE"

Can This Order Change?

Yes! Thread scheduling is not deterministic. In rare cases, if the new thread is scheduled immediately after start(), you might see "State in run(): RUNNABLE" before "State after start: RUNNABLE". However, in most cases, the main thread executes first.
