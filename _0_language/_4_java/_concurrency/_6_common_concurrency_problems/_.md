# Common Concurrency Problems

Concurrency introduces challenges that can lead to unexpected behavior, inefficiency, or system failures. Understanding and mitigating these problems is crucial for building reliable multithreaded applications.

1. Deadlocks

Definition
A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting on each other to release resources, and none can proceed.

Causes
    Circular Wait: Threads form a circular chain, where each thread waits for a resource held by the next.
    Hold and Wait: Threads hold onto one resource while waiting for another.
    No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a thread.
    Mutual Exclusion: Resources are not sharable.

Solution
    Avoid Circular Wait: Always acquire locks in the same order.
    Use Timeouts: Acquire locks with a timeout.
    Deadlock Detection: Monitor thread states and resources.    

2. Livelocks
Definition

A livelock occurs when threads keep changing their states in response to each other but make no progress.
Example

Two threads trying to avoid collision but continually stepping back and retrying.    

3. Starvation
Definition

Occurs when a thread is perpetually denied access to resources because other threads monopolize them.
Causes

    Threads with lower priority are never scheduled.
    Threads waiting for locks held by "greedy" threads.

Solution

    Use fair scheduling policies (e.g., ReentrantLock with fairness in Java).
    Balance thread priorities.

4. Priority Inversion
Definition

Occurs when a high-priority thread is waiting for a resource held by a low-priority thread, but a medium-priority thread preempts the low-priority thread, delaying the high-priority thread.
Solution

    Priority inheritance protocols: Temporarily raise the priority of the low-priority thread holding the resource.

Example in Concept:

    Thread A (low priority) acquires a lock.
    Thread B (high priority) waits for the lock.
    Thread C (medium priority) preempts Thread A, causing delay for Thread B.
    Priority Inheritance: Raise Thread A's priority to prevent Thread C from preempting it.
