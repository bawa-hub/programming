🚀 Phase 1: Foundations of C++ (Beginner Level)
🎯 Goal: Build strong basics with modern C++

    C++ syntax & structure

    Variables, Data Types, Constants

    Input/Output (cin, cout, getline)

    Operators & Expressions

    Conditionals (if, else, switch)

    Loops (for, while, do-while)

    Functions (declaration, definition, overloading)

    Scope & Lifetime of variables

⚙️ Phase 2: Intermediate C++ Concepts
🎯 Goal: Get comfortable writing modular, efficient code

    Arrays, Strings, Vectors

    Pointers and References

    Recursion

    Structures and Unions

    Dynamic Memory (new, delete)

    File I/O

    Basic STL (vector, map, set, stack, queue)

🧱 Phase 3: Object-Oriented Programming in C++
🎯 Goal: Master OOP in C++

    Classes and Objects

    Constructors & Destructors

    this pointer

    Inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel)

    Polymorphism (compile-time & runtime)

    Encapsulation & Abstraction

    Operator Overloading

    Virtual Functions and VTables

    Abstract Classes & Interfaces

⚡ Phase 4: Advanced C++
🎯 Goal: Write high-performance, idiomatic C++ code

    Templates (Function and Class Templates)

    Exception Handling

    Lambda Functions

    Move Semantics

    Smart Pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr, weak_ptr)

    Namespaces & Inline Namespaces

    Type Casting (static_cast, dynamic_cast, etc.)

    Deep dive into STL (unordered_map, priority_queue, algorithms)

    C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20 features

🧠 Phase 5: Mastery-Level: C++ in the Real World
🎯 Goal: Become a system-level C++ wizard

    Memory Management (malloc/free vs new/delete)

    Manual Allocators & Custom Containers

    Function Pointers & Callbacks

    Threads, Mutexes, Locks (C++11 threading)

    Condition Variables & Thread-safe Queues

    Low-level System Calls (read, write, fork, exec, etc.)

    Interfacing with OS via C/C++ (Linux system-level programming)

🛠️ Phase 6: Beast Mode: Projects and Challenges
🎯 Goal: Apply everything to build real stuff

    Build Projects:

        File system explorer

        Custom memory allocator (like malloc)

        Multi-threaded web server

        Mini Shell (Linux command-line shell)

        Simple Game using SFML

    Solve 100+ C++ coding problems

    Source Code Reading: Analyze parts of real open-source C++ code

    Build a C++ Standard Library clone (partial)
