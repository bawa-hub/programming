🚀 Phase 1: Foundations (Language + OS Internals)
1. Pick a Language (We'll start with C and C++)

    ✅ Why C? It’s the backbone of most system software.

    ✅ Why C++? Adds OOP and powerful abstractions while still close to hardware.

2. Learn C/C++ Step by Step

    Memory management: malloc, free, stack vs heap

    Pointers & pointer arithmetic

    Structs, unions, function pointers

    Compilation pipeline (preprocessor → compiler → assembler → linker)

    C++: Classes, inheritance, virtual functions, RAII

3. Understand How Operating Systems Work

    CPU scheduling, processes vs threads

    Memory management (paging, segmentation, virtual memory)

    Filesystems, system calls, kernel vs user mode

    Networking and sockets

🛠️ Phase 2: Tooling & Hands-On Environment
1. Work in Linux

    Use CLI, gdb, strace, ltrace, valgrind

    Write and analyze shell scripts

    Understand how processes are run and managed

2. Build Projects to Reinforce Concepts

    Write a custom malloc() and memory allocator

    Implement your own shell

    Build a basic HTTP server in C

    Create a file system in user-space (FUSE)

    Implement a simplified operating system

⚙️ Phase 3: Advanced Topics

    Writing Linux Kernel Modules

    Working with Embedded Systems

    Multithreading, concurrency, and synchronization

    Interprocess Communication (IPC)

    Low-level Networking with raw sockets

    Writing device drivers

🧠 Phase 4: Deep Dives & Real Projects

    Build your own tiny operating system (e.g., using x86 assembly + C)

    Create a simplified virtual memory manager

    Write a hypervisor or emulator (e.g., like QEMU)

    Contribute to open source projects like Linux Kernel, BusyBox, etc.

🧪 Phase 5: Debugging, Optimization & Internals

    Master tools like perf, nm, objdump, readelf, etc.

    Dissect ELF binaries

    Dive into compiler and linker internals

    Learn cache locality, CPU architecture, and performance tuning
