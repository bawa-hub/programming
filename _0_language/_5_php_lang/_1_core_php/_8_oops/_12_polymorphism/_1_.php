/** 
 * Polymorphism is simply an OOP design pattern 
 * that allows multiple class with various functionalities to implement or share a common Interface.
 * 
 * Generally, it is of two types: compile-time (overloading) and run time (overriding), 
 * but polymorphism in PHP does not support overloading, or in other words, compile-time polymorphism
 * 
 * e.g.
 * A person at the same time can have different characteristics. 
 * Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. 
 * So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. 
 * This is called polymorphism.
