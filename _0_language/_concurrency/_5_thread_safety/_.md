# Thread Safety

Thread safety refers to the design of code to function correctly when multiple threads access shared resources simultaneously. It prevents issues like race conditions, data corruption, and inconsistent states.
Key Concepts in Thread Safety

    Race Conditions:
        Occur when multiple threads access shared resources and try to modify them simultaneously.
        The outcome depends on the order of execution, which is non-deterministic.

    Atomicity:
        Operations that appear indivisible; they either complete fully or not at all.
        Example: Incrementing a counter in a thread-safe manner.

    Immutability:
        Immutable objects (whose state cannot be modified after creation) are inherently thread-safe.
        Example: Strings in many programming languages.

    Thread-Local Storage:
        Each thread has its own copy of variables, ensuring no conflicts.

    The volatile Keyword:
        Ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads.
        Prevents threads from caching stale data.
