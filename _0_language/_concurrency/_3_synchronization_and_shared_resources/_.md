# Thread Synchronization

In multithreaded applications, synchronization is crucial to ensure that multiple threads can safely access shared resources (like memory, files, or other system resources) without causing data corruption or inconsistencies. Without synchronization, threads may interfere with each other, leading to race conditions or other unpredictable behaviors.
What is Synchronization?

Synchronization is the process of controlling the access of multiple threads to shared resources in such a way that only one thread can access a resource at a time. This helps in preventing conflicts or data corruption when multiple threads try to access the same data simultaneously.
Race Conditions

A race condition occurs when two or more threads try to access and modify shared data at the same time, and the final result depends on the timing of thread execution. This can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

For example, imagine two threads that increment a shared counter. If both threads read the counter value at the same time, increment it, and then store the new value, the result will be incorrect because the threads will overwrite each other's changes.
Synchronization Mechanisms

## To avoid race conditions, synchronization can be achieved through various mechanisms:

    Locks (Mutexes):
        Locks are used to ensure that only one thread can access a critical section of code at a time.
        A mutex (short for "mutual exclusion") is a type of lock that only allows one thread to hold it at a time.

    Synchronized Blocks (Java):
        In Java, the synchronized keyword is used to lock a method or a block of code so that only one thread can execute it at a time.

    Semaphores:
        Semaphores are used to control access to a limited number of resources by multiple threads. They are more flexible than mutexes because they allow more than one thread to access a resource concurrently (based on a predefined count).

    Monitors:
        A monitor is an abstraction used in some languages (like Java) that automatically handles locking and unlocking.

    Condition Variables:
        Condition variables are used to synchronize threads based on certain conditions. They are often used in combination with locks.

    Atomic Operations:
        Atomic operations are low-level operations that ensure a resource is updated without interruption.
