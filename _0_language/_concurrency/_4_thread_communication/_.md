# Thread Communication

Thread communication is crucial for coordinating actions between threads, especially in scenarios like producer-consumer problems, shared state management, or event-driven programming. This ensures data consistency and avoids race conditions.

## Shared Memory Communication

    Concept: Threads share a common memory space and communicate by reading and writing shared variables.
    Challenges:
        Requires synchronization mechanisms like locks to ensure data consistency.
        Can lead to race conditions without proper safeguards.

## Inter-Thread Communication

Inter-thread communication allows threads to signal each other and synchronize their operations.

Condition Variables

    Concept: A thread can wait on a condition and be notified when the condition changes.
    Typically implemented using wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().

## Producer-Consumer Problem

    A classic concurrency problem where a producer creates data and a consumer uses it.
    Requires synchronization to avoid overproduction or underconsumption.

## Message-Passing Systems

    Threads communicate by passing messages, often avoiding shared memory and synchronization issues.
    Common in distributed systems and languages like Go.

## Events and Signals

    Events allow threads to wait for a specific signal before continuing execution.
