# Thread Lifecycle

A thread can be in one of the following states:

    New: The thread is created but not started yet.
    Runnable: The thread is ready to run and waiting for the CPU to be assigned.
    Running: The thread is being executed by the CPU.
    Blocked: The thread is waiting for a resource (like I/O, synchronization, etc.).
    Terminated: The thread has finished executing.

A thread goes through several states during its lifecycle, from its creation to its completion. These states are typically managed by the operating system or the runtime environment (e.g., JVM for Java, Python interpreter).
Thread States

In most thread models, the thread can be in one of the following states:

    New (Born):
        A thread is in this state when it is first created, but before it starts executing.
        In Java, a thread is in the New state as soon as an instance of Thread or Runnable is created but before calling start().

    Runnable (Ready to run):
        A thread moves to the Runnable state after calling start(). It is now eligible to run but may be waiting for the CPU to execute it.
        A thread may remain in the Runnable state even if it's not actually executing (depending on the scheduler and CPU).

    Running:
        This is the state when the thread is actually executing code. The operating system's scheduler allocates CPU time to the thread, and it performs its task.

    Blocked (Waiting):
        A thread is in the Blocked state when it cannot execute because it's waiting for some resource or event, such as I/O completion, or waiting for a lock (in the case of synchronization).
        The thread will remain in the Blocked state until the required resource or event becomes available.

    Terminated (Dead):
        A thread enters the Terminated state once it has completed its task or been interrupted. After a thread has terminated, it cannot be restarted.    



Key Takeaways:

    Threads go through multiple states: New, Runnable, Running, Blocked, and Terminated.
    Thread management involves starting, joining, and sometimes interrupting threads to control execution.
    Java, Python, Go, and PHP offer different mechanisms for managing threads and their execution flow.
