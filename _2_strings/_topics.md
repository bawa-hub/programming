ðŸ§  Phases to Master String Algorithms
Phase 1: Fundamentals

Weâ€™ll build a strong base with must-know string operations.

    String Traversal & Manipulation
    String Matching Basics (Naive, Brute Force)
    Reversal, Palindromes, Anagrams
    Prefixes, Suffixes, Substrings

Phase 2: Core String Algorithms

Learn and implement the foundational algorithms.

    Pattern Matching

        Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
        Rabin-Karp
        Z-Algorithm
        Boyer-Moore

    Suffix-Based Algorithms
        Suffix Array
        LCP Array
        Suffix Tree (conceptual and applications)

    Tries (Prefix Trees)
        Insertion, Search, Auto-complete
        Longest Prefix Matching
        Word Dictionary with Wildcards

    Advanced Algorithms
        Aho-Corasick Algorithm (Multi-pattern matching)
        Manacherâ€™s Algorithm (Longest Palindromic Substring)
        Rolling Hash & String Hashing
        Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) - Bonus for compression

Phase 3: Advanced Problem Patterns

Weâ€™ll solve categorized problems:

    Sliding Window
    Two Pointers
    Backtracking with Strings
    Dynamic Programming on Strings
    Greedy Techniques
    Bitmasking (like reconstructing strings)
