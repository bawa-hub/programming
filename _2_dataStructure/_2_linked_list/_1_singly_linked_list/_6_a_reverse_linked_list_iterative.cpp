// Time Complexity:
// Since we are iterating only once through the list and achieving reversed list. Thus, the time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes present in the list.
// Space Complexity:
// To perform given tasks, no external spaces are used except three-pointers. So, space complexity is O(1).
