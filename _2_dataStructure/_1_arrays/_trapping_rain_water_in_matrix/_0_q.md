# Given a matrix arr[][] of dimension M\*N consisting of positive integers, where arr[i][j] represents the height of each unit cell, the task is to find the total volume of water trapped in the matrix after rain.

## Input: arr[][] = {{4, 2, 7}, {2, 1, 10}, {5, 10, 2}}

## Output: 1

## Input: arr[][] = {{1, 4, 3, 1, 3, 2}, {3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 1}}

## Output: 4
